# loopHole

loophole is a web application allowing users to set up playback loops inside YouTube videos. It is aimed toward musicians who want a better experience using YouTube tutorials to learn music. The user can paste a YouTube link of their choice into the app, and then set up a start-time, end-time, and playback speed for their loop. Users can also save session data and comeback to the loopHole at any time to have their session restored where they left off.
